****Java Script Execution Context*****
we will know how the javaScript runs iternally.

Types: 
    Global Execution Context
    Function Execution Context
    Eval Execution Context(used in mongo db)


steps of Execution:

1 Global Execution 
1.1 Memory Allocation phase
    varaible = undefined 
    function = defination (exact copy of original)
1.2 code Execution 
    ->actual Execution
    ->value assignment
    ->if there is any function call 
      A new execution context/thread will create 
        {
            Allocation
            execution
        }
        after return it will deleted 
    ->Each time whenever any function is called a new execution environment is created
